## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with development you need to install a few things.

1. [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download); IDE used for development
2. [**MongoDB**](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/); for storing data on the backend
3. [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Running the app

To get the development version of the app up and running, you can do:

```
npm install
npm run client-install
npm run dev 
```

You can also run the client and server individually with `npm run client` and `npm run server` respectively.
